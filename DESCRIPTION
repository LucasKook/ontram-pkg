Description: Package ontram implements ordinal transformation models using
    neural networks. Models are fit using stochastic gradient descent to
    maximize the log-likelihood under any form of uninformative censoring
    and truncation. Transformation models are described here (...) and 
    ordinal transformation neural networks are described in the accompanying
    package vignette.
